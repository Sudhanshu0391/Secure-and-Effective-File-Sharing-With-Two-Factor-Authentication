# Secure-and-Effective-File-Sharing-With-Two-Factor-Authentication
In this paper, we introduce a new Multi access System for cloud Computing Services Specifically, in our proposed  access control system, 
an attribute-based access control mechanism is implemented with the necessity of both a user secret key and a Trustee request. 
User canâ€™t able to access the cloud data without secret key and trustee request, especially in those scenarios where many users 
share the same computer for web-based cloud services. In addition, attribute-based control in the system also enables the cloud server 
to restrict the access to those users with the same set of attributes while preserving user privacy, i.e., the cloud server only knows 
that the user fulfils the required predicate, but has no idea on the exact identity of the user. Finally, we also carry out a simulation 
to demonstrate the practicability of our proposed system.
